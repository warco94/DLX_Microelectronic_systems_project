To synthesize the design, put 

- the .synopsys_dc.setup file
- the syn.tcl file of your choice from one of the folders with the synthesized results 
- the contents from the syn_vhd folder 

all in the same folder.

After that, open a terminal in that folder, run the command setsynopsys, start Design Vision and then just
source the syn.tcl file from the tcl CLI inside the software.
